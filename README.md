# **Fuel Route Optimization API**  

## **Overview**  
This project provides an API that calculates an optimal fuel-up route for a vehicle traveling between two locations in the USA. The goal is to **minimize fuel cost** while ensuring the vehicle never runs out of fuel. The API integrates **OpenRouteService (ORS) for route calculation** and **Mapbox for geolocation processing**.

## **Key Features**  
Fetches **optimal fuel stations** along the route.  
Ensures the **vehicle never travels more than 500 miles** without refueling.  
Selects **stations based on price** while staying **on route**.  
Uses **Haversine formula** to calculate distances between stations and the route.  
Integrates **OpenRouteService for routing** and **Mapbox for geolocation**.  
Returns the **total fuel cost** based on consumption.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Processing with Mapbox**  
### **Fuel Stations CSV & Mapbox Integration**  
Initially, the dataset **did not include latitude and longitude** for fuel stations, only their **addresses**. To obtain their coordinates, we used **Mapbox API**:

1. **Read fuel station data from CSV** (name, address, city, state, price, etc.).
2. **Query Mapbox API** to retrieve `latitude` and `longitude` for each station.
3. **Save enriched data** with coordinates into the database.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Route Calculation with OpenRouteService**  
### **Fetching the Route**  
The API takes **start and end coordinates** as input and queries OpenRouteService:

- ORS returns a **route with step-by-step navigation**.
- The API extracts **the route geometry** (as a polyline) and **the total distance**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimizing Fuel Stops**  
### **Constraints Considered**  
üîπ The **vehicle has a max range of 500 miles** per fuel-up.  
üîπ The **cheapest station** within **5 miles of the route** is selected.  
üîπ The **stations must follow the route sequence** (no detours).  

### **Algorithm**  
1. Decode **route geometry (polyline)** to get **waypoints**.
2. Loop through **every 500 miles** of the route to check for **fuel stops**.
3. Select **stations within 5 miles of the route**.
4. Choose the **cheapest fuel station** within that range.
5. Move to the **next 500-mile segment** and repeat.
6. Return **all optimal stops** along with total fuel cost.
